# YippiAPIPA Recipe

This recipe is based on the 2017 UI5con beer "PullToRefresh IPA" but was developed further, mainly by using different hops varieties and increasing the amount of hops by ~60%. It was then brewed by the UI5 team itself, in collaboration with René from http://hopfenkind.de at his brewing place for the UI5con@SAP 2018 conference. The recipe below has been scaled down proportionally to typical homebrewing size.

### Beer Name:
The name was invented during the later stages of brewing, so don't ask. :-) However, it still means something:   
- First, the name is supposed to convey the fun we had brewing the beer.  
- Second, it's an API, erm... an IPA, I mean. The same sometimes happens in work meetings - just the other way round.  
- Third, pronounce the name aloud! You still can? Then you need more YippiAPIPA!
