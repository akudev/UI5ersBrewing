# UI5ersBrewing

## Content
This repository contains the recipes of the beers which were brewed for the UI5con@SAP conferences 2017 and 2018, as well as related resources.
Feel free to fork and adapt the recipes and brew the beers on your own!

Basic knowledge about the (home-)brewing process is assumed, this repository will not teach the basics of brewing.

## The Beers
Both beers brewed so far, the ["PullToRefresh IPA"](docs/PullToRefresh_IPA_recipe.md)  and the ["YippiAPIPA"](docs/YippiAPIPA_recipe.md), are "New England India Pale Ales". This new beer style originating from north-eastern USA tastes typically more fruity and less bitter than regular IPAs and has a quite hazy appearance, visually supporting the fruity taste.  

The PullToRefresh IPA has a fruity (citrus/orange), but also spicy aroma and taste, resulting from the hop varieties Citra®, El Dorado®, and Summit™.
